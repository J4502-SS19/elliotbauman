				<p>I had a dream I could buy my way to heaven. When I awoke, I spent that on a necklace. I told God I'd be back in a second, man it's so hard not to act reckless. </p>
				<p>To whom much is given, much is tested. Get arrested guess until he get the message. I feel the pressure, under more scrutiny. And what I do? Act more stupidly. </p>
				<p>Bought more jewelry, more Louis V. My Momma couldn't get through to me. The drama, people suing me. I'm on TV talking like it's just you and me. </p>
				<p>I'm just saying how I feel man. I ain't one of the Cosby's, I ain't go to Hillman. I guess the money should've changed him. I guess I should've forgot where I came from. </p>

				<p>La, la, la la. Wait 'til I get my money right. La, la, la la. Then you can't tell me nothing, right? Excuse me, was you saying something? Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing. You can't tell me nothing. Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing</p>
